This plugin is a proof of concept for trigonometry type stuff in Minecraft. Not sure how else to put it.

Place the structure found in trig_poc/structures/ in your spawn chunks, flip the lever on it, then right click a carrot on a stick.
It will spawn armorstands named "trig_output" in the direction you're facing. Run "kill @e[name=trig_output]" when it gets to be too much

If I was better at math I'd have it use fireballs or wither skulls instead. Couldn't quite get those to work right.

This should work with more than one player.
