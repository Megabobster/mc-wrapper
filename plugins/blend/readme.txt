This plugin is a proof of concept for disenchanting items.
It needs a little work as far as balance goes, and definitely could be updated to use parse_nbt.sed and Python instead of the regex it uses right now, but it's functional enough to show it works.
This is the first complex script I wrote for this wrapper and it hasn't been updated since so you can see why it's a little outdated.

To use it, type "!blend" in chat. Like you're putting your item in a blender and getting only the essence out :)
The plugin will tell you what to do from there.
