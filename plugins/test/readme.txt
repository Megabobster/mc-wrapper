This is a very important plugin that handles a lot of built in functions. I wouldn't recommend disabling or deleting it.

Try some stuff like "!run" or "/say test" or even just "test"
Or maybe "/tp @e[type=Pig] ~ ~ ~"
Or "/tp @e[type=Pig] @p"

There's also "!halt" which kills the wrapper (but not the server) and "!stop", which kills the wrapper and the server.
That's the main reason you shouldn't disable this.
